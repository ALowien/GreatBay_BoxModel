## Background

Purpose: A repository of data and scripts necessary to create a box-model for solute loading to Great Bay Estuary, NH/ME. This repository is associated with the submitted paper "Biogeochemical Stressors and Ecological Response in a Nitrogen-Impaired New England Estuary". Data was sourced from the UNH Water Quality Analysis Lab, the NH Department of Environmental Services, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online Database, the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership, and the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.

  6. Type "git clone", then paste the URL.
  7. Hit Enter. 

## Usage

This repository is organized into three main folders, with appropriate sub-folders.

### **data**

The data folder contains the cleaned data resources used to build the box model (solute budgets) & manuscript figures.

#### ecological_response
##### Contains *eelgrass_acres* file with annual coverage of *Zostera marina* seagrass in Great Bay and Great Bay Estuary obtained from monitoring reports by the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership. 

#### emd
##### Contains raw water quality data (2401213_GrabSample_PhysChem_GreatBay.xlsx) for the head of tide river stations (05-LMP, 09-EXT, 02-WNC) and the estuary site (GRBAP). Includes all site metadata, along with sample date, time, water quality data for each station. Each row is one water quality solute measured on a given day and site (long data). These data were downloaded upon request from the NH Environmental Monitoring Database (DES.EMD@des.nh.gov). The only modifications were to make the column names the first row of the spreadsheet and to delete the database query notes from the bottom of the spreadsheet, making it readable in R. These files currently are up-to-date through the 2021 and/or 2022 calendar year, depending on the site. 

##### The cleaned dataset (surfacewaterchemistry_conc.csv) has been filtered for solutes of interest, corrected for values below detection limit (set to 1/2 of method detection limit), cleaned for invalid data values, and is the processed datafile used for the solute budgets. Date of download: February 13, 2025.

#### discharge
##### The daily mean discharge for the three rivers the drain to Great Bay (Lamprey (LR), Squamscott (SQR), and Winnicut (WNC). The csv files contain the site id, date, and mean daily discharge (units: cfs). The *text_files* subfolder has the .txt version of the .csv files. Tributary discharge data are available from the USGS National Water Information System (https://waterdata.usgs.gov). Date of download: May 22, 2024. 

#### precipitation
##### The precipitation chemistry and rainfall volumes are located here. Hourly precipitation was downloaded from the NCDC U.S. Climate Reference Network for the Durham, NH SSW station. Gaps were filled using UNH weather statistics. 

#### npdes_wwtf
##### Monitoring data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ECHO for each wastewater treatment facility. Data files are identified by town name where the wastewater treatemnt facility is located. The files within the *generalpermit* subfolder contain monitoring data following implementation of the 2020 General Nitrogen Permit, which provided different NPDES IDs for each wastewater treatment facilty. Date of download: July 2024

#### wwtf
##### Data sourced from published reports, including annual loads or measured concentrations. A cleaned, compiled version *wwtf_concentrations.csv* of the data maintained in the npdes_wwtf folder is provided here and can be used directly for the solute budget. 

* wwtf_annualloads - contains the annual loads from 2008 - 2013 sourced from the literature
* literature_wwtf_concentrations - contains concentrations of DOC, PO4, and TN in wastewater effluent from the literature. 
* exeter_monthlyTN_2012_2013 - contains the monthly average concentration of TN reported by the Town of Exeter for the Exeter WWTF in 2012 and 2013. Data not available in ECHO. 


### **src**

The src folder contains all R scripts needed to complete the box model for Great Bay. They are described in the order that they should be run.

#### main_dataformat.R
##### Purpose: Read in the processed water quality concentration data for tidal tributaries to Great Bay and for estuarine monitoring stations in Great Bay.
###### Key results from main_dataformat.R saved in /results/main_dataformat 
* "Q_tidal_tribs" - combined discharge dataframe for Lamprey, Squamscott, and Winnicut Rivers
* Table S1, Supplemental Information, Average Concentrations by Site
* Figure S1 Salinity at the Squamscott River pre- and post-dam removal

#### main_load_calc.R
##### Purpose: Calculate flow-weighted annual (calendar year) and monthly solute loads for the three tidal tributaries of Great Bay (Lamprey, Squamscott, & Winnicut). This script relies on csv files (surfacewaterchemistry_conc.csv) and (Q_tidal_Tribs.csv).
###### Key final products: 
* Calendar year loads for each tributary saved in results/main_load_calc/FW_loads
* Flow weighted concentrations are saved in results/main_load_calc/FWC

#### main_estuarine_load_calc.R
##### Purpose: Calculates high and low tide flux of solutes based on river input of freshwater and known tidal prism. This script uses (surfacewaterchemistry_conc.csv). Products created in this script are saved in results/main_estuarine_load_calc

###### Key final products: 
* "AP_Flux_kgyr.csv" - dataframe of high and low tide estuarine fluxes
* "AP_Monthly_Flux_kgmonth.csv" - dataframe of monthly estuarine fluxes

#### main_precipitation_format.R
##### Purpose: Calculates precipitation-weighted concentrations for precipitation over Great Bay estuary using rain chemistry from UNH Thompson Farm

###### Key final products: 
* "cy_precip_loads.csv" - dataframe of calendar year precipitation fluxes

#### main_runoff.R
##### Purpose: Estimates load from coastal runoff for area surrounding Great Bay that is not encompassed by river watersheds. Estimates use the Lamprey River loads and watershed areas as a model system.

###### Key final products: 
* "runoff_estimate_kgyr.csv" - dataframe of runoff fluxes

#### main_wwtf_format.R
##### Purpose: Combines wastewater treatment facility water flux with concentration data for TN, DIN, and TSS into wastewater treatment loads for facilities downstream of the tidal tributary monitoring stations. C and P fluxes were estimated using C:N:P ratios for the epping wastewater treatment facility.


###### Key final products:
* "wwtf_annual_loads.csv" - wastewater treatment estimated loads

#### main_dilution_calculation.R
##### Purpose: Exercise to see what we would expect the N concentration in Great Bay to be if the rivers were the only N source. How much does the river load dilute once in the estuary?

#### main_compile_inputs.R
##### Purpose: Combine input loads and output loads into one dataframe, calculate delta storage terms. Requires loading of products saved in results files, including:
* Tidal_Trib_CY_Loads_kg_yr.csv
* cy_precip_loads.csv
* wwtf_annual_loads.csv
* AP_Flux_kgyr.csv
* runoff_estimate_kgyr.csv"

###### Key final products:
* Budget_Components.csv - dataframe of each budget component solute flux, categorized as input or output

#### main_plot_annual_budgets.R
##### Purpose: Plot annual solute budget inputs, outputs, and delta storage terms using the dataframes built in main_compile_inputs


### **results**

The results folder is organized by "src" script, with a corresponding folder for each script to hold interim products like datatables or figures.

#### manuscript_figures

This folder holds final figures associated with the manuscript.

#### Notes
When running these scripts, keep track of where you are saving things. The scripts are organized in such a way that one can work within a project space. Within the project space, created products will be saved down into a "results" folder.
