##### Purpose: A respository of data and scripts necessary to create a box-model for solute loading to Great Bay Estuary, NH/ME. This respository is associated with the M.S. Thesis Work titled, "Biogeochemical Stressors and Ecological Reponse in Great Bay Estuary, NH/ME". Data was sourced from monitoring efforts of the UNH Water Quality Analyis Lab, the NH Department of Environmental Services, the Piscataqua Region Estuaries Partnership, and the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. 


### **Data**

#### original_files/Original_EMD
##### Contains water quality data for the head of tide river stations (05-LMP, 09-EXT, 02-WNC, GRBAP). Includes sample date, time, water quality data for each station. These data files were downloaded via rqequest from the publicly accessible NH Environmental Monitoring Database. The only modifications were to make the column names the first row of the spreadsheet and to delete the database query from the bottom of the spreadsheet. 


### 

### **Source Scripts**
#### main_dataformat.R
##### Purpose: Read in, process, and clean up water quality concentration data for tidal tributaries to Great Bay and for estuarine monitoring stations in Great Bay. 
###### Key results from main_dataformat.R saved in /results/main_dataformat 
* "df_conc.csv" - data frame of organized solute concentrations by date and site, corrected for method detection limits (except for DON concentrations)
* "Q_tidal_tribs" - combined discharge dataframe for Lamprey, Squamscott, and Winnicut Rivers

#### main_load_calc.R
##### Purpose: Calculate flow-weighted annual (calendar year) and monthly solute loads for the three tidal tributaries of Great Bay (Lamprey, Squamscott, & Winnicut). This script relies on csv files created by the main_dataformat.R script, including (df_conc.csv) and (Q_tidal_Tribs.csv).
###### Key final products: 
* Calendar year loads for each tributary saved in results/main_load_calc/FW_loads
* Flow weighted concentrations are saved in results/main_load_calc/FWC

#### main_estuarine_load_calc.R
##### Purpose: Calculates high and low tide flux of solutes based on river input of freshwater and known tidal prism. This script uses the saved output from the main_dataformat.R script (df_conc.csv). Products created in this script are saved in results/main_estuarine_load_calc

###### Key final products: 
* "AP_Flux_kgyr.csv" - dataframe of high and low tide estuarine fluxes
* "AP_Monthly_Flux_kgmonth.csv" - dataframe of monthly estuarine fluxes

#### main_precipitation_format.R
##### Purpose: Calculates precipitation-weighted concentrations for precipitation over Great Bay estuary using rain chemistry from UNH Thompson Farm

###### Key final products: 
* "cy_precip_loads.csv" - dataframe of calendar year precipitation fluxes

#### main_runoff.R
##### Purpose: Estimates load from coastal runoff for area surrounding Great Bay that is not encompassed by river watersheds. Estimates use the Lamprey River loads and watershed areas as a model system.

###### Key final products: 
* "runoff_estimate_kgyr.csv" - dataframe of runoff fluxes

#### main_wwtf_format.R
##### Purpose: Combines wastewater treatment facility water flux with concentration data for TN, DIN, and TSS into wastewater treatment loads for facilities downstream of the tidal tributary monitoring stations. C and P fluxes were estimated using C:N:P ratios for the epping wastewater treatment facility.

###### Key final products:
* "wwtf_annual_loads.csv" - wastewater treatment estimated loads

#### main_dilution_calculation.R
##### Purpose: Exercise to see what we would expect the N concentration in Great Bay to be if the rivers were the only N source. How much does the river load dilute once in the estuary?

#### main_compile_inputs.R
##### Purpose: Combine input loads and output loads into one dataframe, calculate delta storage terms. Requires loading of products saved in results files, including:
* LR_Annual_Loads.csv
* SQR_Annual_Loads.csv
* WNC_Annual_Loads.csv
* cy_precip_loads.csv
* wwtf_annual_loads.csv
* AP_Flux_kgyr.csv
* runoff_estimate_kgyr.csv"

###### Key final products:
* Budget_Components.csv - dataframe of each budget component solute flux, categorized as input or output
* inputsaspercentage.csv - dataframe that considers inputs as percentage of the total input for the year

#### main_plot_annual_budgets.R
##### Purpose: Plot annual solute budget inputs, outputs, and delta storage terms using the dataframes built in main_compile_inputs

#### Notes
When running these scripts, keep track of where you are saving things. The scripts are organized in such a way that one can work within a project space. Within the project space, created products will be saved down into a "results" folder.
